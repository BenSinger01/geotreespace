Description: Tools for statistical measure of phylogeographic concordance or incompatibilities,
             aimed at detecting differences between geographical histories in terms of
             distances between phylogeographies. These incompatibility measures can be applied
             to any phylogeography, and more generally to any phylogeny where each tip has been assigned
             a geographical discrete location or any other continuous/discrete 'trait' independent of the sequence.
